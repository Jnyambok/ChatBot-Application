      "The majority of Sokovians were rescued, even as the Avengers were forced to blow up the city in order to save the Earth\n",
      "Ultron, in the meantime, was stopped completely, as all of his sentries were destroyed, with Vision taking out the final robot before it could escape\n",
      "The aftermath of this battle created a lot of changes to the Avengers roster\n",
      "Although he might have joined, Pietro was killed in the battle protecting Hawkeye\n",
      "Hulk decided to fly off in the Avengersâ€™ Quinjet after helping in the fight, rather than rejoin the team\n",
      "Thor returned to the cosmos to investigate the unsettling number of events involving Infinity Stones, while Tony Stark decided to take a step back from the team\n",
      "Now working out of a new headquarters owned by Stark in upstate New York, Captain America and Black Widow formed a second incarnation of the Avengers, comprised of the two of them and new recruits Vision, Scarlet Witch, Falcon, and War Machine\n",
      "During a mission in Lagos to stop Crossbones (Brock Rumlow), Scarlet Witch, acting to save Captain America when Rumlow set off an explosive device intended to kill both himself and Cap, used her powers to send the explosive hurtling into the airâ€”accidently killing several Wakandan humanitarian workers when the explosion hit the building they were in\n",
      "Wracked with guilt over this event and others, Tony, working with Secretary of State Thaddeus Ross, backed the introduction of the Sokovia Accords\n",
      "Agreed upon by the United Nations, the Accordsâ€™ purpose was to create oversight when it comes to the actions of the Avengers, meaning a UN panel would be able to control what missions they took and what parts of the world they traveled to\n",
      "The Accords caused a major rift between Tony and Steve Rogers, who strongly opposed them\n",
      "Both recruited heroes to their sides after Rogers old friend, Bucky Barnes, was framed for the bombing of the Accords ratification summit, which resulted in the death of Wakandaâ€™s king, Tâ€™Chaka\n",
      "The situation escalated, as Rogers was actively helping a wanted criminal avoid the authorities, made worse by Barnesâ€™ past as the brainwashed HYDRA assassin called the Winter Soldier, whose body count was infamous long before the UN summit was bombed\n",
      "Standing with Stark to bring in Rogers, Barnes, and their allies were Rhodes, Vision, and Romanoff, while Wakandaâ€™s Prince Tâ€™Challa, the Black Panther, and Spider-Man (Peter Parker), were also recruited to help\n",
      "Rogers and Barnes were joined in their fight by fellow Avengers Falcon, Hawkeye and Scarlet Witch, along with Ant-Man\n",
      "(Scott Lang) The two teams had a ferocious fight at an airport in Berlin, which culminated in Rogers and Barnesâ€™ escaping thanks to an assist by Romanoff, who switched sides, while Rhodes was badly injured by a miscalculated shot from his teammate, Vision\n",
      "Rogers and Barnes learned the true culprit behind the bombing was Sokovian intelligence officer Helmut Zemo, tracking him to a HYDRA base in Siberia\n",
      "Stark also learned Zemo was responsible, and briefly teamed with Rogers and Barnes to bring him inâ€”only for Zemo to reveal to Stark that Bucky, while brainwashed and operating on HYDRAâ€™s orders, had killed Tonyâ€™s parents\n",
      "Having learned both the shocking circumstances of his parentsâ€™ death, and that Rogers had already known this, but kept the truth from him, Tony was unable to contain his rage\n",
      "Iron Man engaged in a vicious fight with Captain America and Bucky, ending with Iron Manâ€™s defeat and Captain America and Buckyâ€™s escape, while Black Panther stopped Zemo from killing himself and took him into custody\n",
      "Shortly after, Rogers would break his friends and allies Maximoff, Barton, Lang, and Wilson out of confinement in the prison called the Raft\n",
      "While Lang and Barton, not willing to be away from their families, would accept deals and go under house arrest, Rogers, Maximoff, and Wilson would go on the run as fugitives\n",
      "They were joined by Romanoff, now also wanted for her betrayal of Starkâ€™s team in Berlin\n",
      "Stark, Vision, and Rhodesâ€”learning to use a device from Stark in order to walk again following his injuryâ€”still occupied Avengers headquarters\n",
      "Although there was no longer an ongoing Avengers team in operation, Stark offered Parker Avengers membership, which the young man declined\n",
      "Rogers, in the meantime, sent Stark a note about how sorry he was about what had occurred, along with a phone that could be used to reach him in an emergency\n",
      "As time went on, Vision and Scarlet Witch began secretly seeing each other, exploring a potential romance\n",
      "In New York, Bruce Banner returned to Earth after years off-planet, warning the sorcerers Doctor Strange and Wong about the impending threat of Thanos, after he witnessed the massacre of the Asgardian refugees\n",
      "Tony Stark was brought to Strangeâ€™s sanctum, learning more about Thanosâ€™ plan to assemble all six Infinity Stones to wipe out half of all life in the universe\n",
      "When Thanosâ€™ agents came for the Time Stone that Strange possessed, Strange was taken onboard their ship, with Iron Man and Spider-Man, who had come to help, both stowing away on the ship\n",
      "Freeing Strange from captivity, Iron Man declared Spider-Man was now officially an Avenger, as the trio traveled to Thanosâ€™ long dead home planet of Titan, where they encountered Guardians of the Galaxy members Star-Lord, Mantis, and Drax\n",
      "On Earth, Banner used Starkâ€™s phone, dropped during the confrontation over the Time Stone, to contact Rogers\n",
      "Thanks to Bannerâ€™s warning, Rogers, Romanoff and Wilson arrived to help Maximoff and Vision in Scotland, who were also under attack by two of the Children of Thanos, who sought Visionâ€™s Mind Stone\n",
      "Fending them off, the former Avengers traveled back to the teamâ€™s old headquarters, where they reunited with Rhodes and Banner\n",
      "Thaddeus Ross ordered Rhodes to arrest the returning\n",
      "Knowing the Mind Stone needed to be destroyed to keep it from Thanos, a plan was devised to safely remove it from Vision first, which required the technological expertise of Wakanda\n",
      "With Tâ€™Challa agreeing to help, Rogersâ€™ expanded group traveled to Wakanda and readied to fight alongside Tâ€™Challa himself, Barnes, and the mighty forces of the country, as Thanos sent an army to retrieve the Mind Stone\n",
      "A massive battle broke out, with the Avengers receiving crucial aid by the timely arrival of Thor, who also finally returned to Earth, having crafted a powerful new weapon, the axe called Stormbreaker, to take down Thanos\n",
      "Thor and his Guardians of the Galaxy friends Groot and Rocket helped turn the tide, with Thanosâ€™ forces beginning to crumble\n",
      "On Titan, Iron Man and his allies attempted to not only stop Thanos himself from personally acquiring the Time Stone, but also wrest his Infinity Gauntlet, which he was using to harness all of the stones, from his hand\n",
      "Unfortunately, even with Thanosâ€™ vengeful daughter, Nebula, joining their fight, this plan would fail\n",
